This Golang project implements a Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) system focusing on preventing Deadlocks in Goroutines usage. It's structured to provide flexibility in job function management and inter-job communication. Below is a breakdown of its main components and functionalities:

1. JobFunc, JobResult, and JobManager
JobFunc: Defined as a representation of a generic job function.
JobResult: Used to store the results of a job along with metadata, such as the job name and the client who initiated the job.
JobManager: Manages job functions and subscriptions. It also has a channel for sending job results.
2. Job Management
RegisterJob: Registers a job with a specific name and function.
SubscribeJob: Sets up a subscription from one job to another.
StartJob: Initiates a job by invoking the job function using reflection to handle a variety of arguments.
3. Processing and Forwarding Jobs
ListenForResults: A Goroutine function waiting for results from the resultCh channel and forwards them to subscribers.
NotifySubscribersWithDelay: Notifies subscribers of a job's completion, with an optional delay.
4. Safe Program Termination
gracefulTermination: A function for handling signals to terminate the program safely.
5. Example Job Functions
Several example job functions are provided, such as exampleJob, noInputReturnsOutput, inputNoOutput, and noInputNoOutput.
Key Points to Avoid Deadlock
Careful use of Goroutines and Channels.
Managing the size and capacity of Channels.
Using Select for channel communication in certain scenarios.
